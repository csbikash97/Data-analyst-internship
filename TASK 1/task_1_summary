# 🧹 Task 1 — Data Cleaning with Pandas
## 📘 Overview
This Jupyter Notebook (`Task1.ipynb`) demonstrates a **step-by-step data cleaning process** using **Python and pandas**.  
It focuses on identifying and fixing common data quality issues such as:
- Missing values
- Duplicate records
- Inconsistent data formats
- Date and time parsing
- Column type corrections
The cleaned dataset is finally exported for further analysis or visualization.
## 🧠 Learning Objectives
By the end of this notebook, you will learn how to:
1. Import and explore datasets using pandas.  
2. Detect and remove duplicate or missing records.  
3. Convert column datatypes (e.g., object → numeric or datetime).  
4. Extract and manipulate date/time components (Date, Day, Month).  
5. Clean inconsistent data formats (e.g., Patient IDs, date formats).  
6. Export the cleaned dataset to CSV or Excel for later use.
